 My intellectual objective has been to elaborate a formula of critique for politically valiant social analysis, suitable for the conceptualization of radical social change. The evolution of this project is articulated below, referenced to the relevant publications.

My efforts at politically engaged philosophical reflection began with my involvement with the dissident movements in my native Bulgaria in the late 1980s. I observed a continuity between the nascent post-communist democracy and the old regime, questioning prevalent at the time optimistic prognoses for the future of liberal democracy in Eastern Europe (Azmanova 1992[^1]). This trajectory of research was continued in Azmanova 2001[^2], 2006[^3], 2009a[^4], 2009b[^5]

My doctoral work at the New School for Social Research in New York focused on theories of justice and judgment, as I explored the capacity of public deliberations on social justice to have not only validating and consensus-building, but also a critical, emancipatory force. I formulated the dilemma of normative political theory in terms of what I called the ‘judgment paradox’ – the more we weaken our normative criteria, the more we enhance judgment’s political realism at the expense of its critical power; however, the higher we set the normative standards, the more we lose our grip on political reality— again at the expense of judgment’s critical power (2012a[^6]: 3-4). To solve this paradox, I elaborated a model of critical judgment based on a pragmatist political epistemology, by drawing on Aristotle’s notion of phronesis and Kant’s notion of reflective judgment. I articulate the conditions under which public deliberations on justice generate what I describe as a critical consensus – a shared understanding of the common social roots of seemingly irreconcilable positions, which allows citizens to maintain a critical stance on the norms they embrace as binding, as well as engage successfully in transformative social practices (ibid: Ch7-9). Aspects of this model of agonistic, emancipatory deliberations are developed in 2011a, 2011c, and 2013c.

Another trajectory of my research has been dedicated to bringing the critique of political economy (back) into political and social theory. I observe the disengagement of critical theory from the critique of the structural dynamics of contemporary capitalism (2014, 2019e, 2019c) and propose to shift our thinking on social justice beyond issues of inequality and exclusion (2014). I recast the model of ‘immanent critique’ developed within the Frankfurt School of critical theory away from the communicative turn, in order to ground social criticism more firmly in the critique of political economy. This allows me to focus on the key systemic dynamics and structural contradictions of contemporary capitalism (2012b). At the center of my theoretical framework is an articulation of three types of social domination: systemic (rooted in the constitutive dynamics of the social system), structural (rooted in the structuring institutions), and relational (rooted in power asymmetries); these are also three trajectories along which intellectual critique and social criticism are to pursue emancipation (2020a, 2018b, 2016b). Emancipatory practice is to target these three types of domination, while radical, revolutionary practice is to target specifically systemic domination. Thus, I shift the critique of capitalism from issues of distributive injustice and property relations (which are matters of, respectively, relational and structural domination) to the competitive production of profit – capitalism’s constitutive dynamic which engenders systemic domination. Drawing on this theoretical model, I also spell out a methodology of analysis for critical social theory (2020a, Ch2).

This recasting of the analysis of social domination allows me to argue that social and political theory’s contribution to progressive politics is often undermined by what I call the ‘emancipation paradox’: success in fighting one form of domination often comes at the price of aggravating another form of domination (2019b). I have displayed the way the emancipation paradox plays out in feminist struggles for emancipation in analyses that urge the degendering of social justice, and advance a formula of socially embedded autonomy that unites work, care, and leisure (2012c, 2016b). My account of the enabling conditions for progressive politics leads me to introduce the notion of meta-rights and elaborate the conception of the ‘right to politics’ -- the right of having one’s grievance of injustice (be it suffered by us or by others) to be considered a relevant social concern and a valid object of policy making (2016a).

I have deployed the above-described theoretical framework in the analysis of contemporary capitalist democracy as an institutionalised socio-political order. I identify the spreading economic and social uncertainty (precarity) to be at the heart of the social question of our times (2004a, 2012b), fueling economic xenophobia (2011a) and generating populism as a matter of political mis-articulation of a valid social grievance (2018c) which is to be countered by means of a set of policies that institute what I name a ‘political economy of trust’ (2011a, 2017, 2020a).

In contrast to analyses that attribute the rise of populism to a democratic deficit, economic crisis, or eroding national sovereignty, I trace the roots of the anti-establishment revolts to what I conceptualise as ‘socially irresponsible rule’, in contrast to responsive, accountable, and effective rule (2013a). Moreover, I propose to see populist parties and movements not as temporary mobilisations at the extremes of the left-right political spectrum, but as a symptom of a stable reconfiguration of the ideological landscape of liberal democracies, in which the left-right divide is being replaced by what I name opportunity-risk divide (Azmanova 2004a, 2004b, 2011b). This reconfiguration, in turn, is part of the thorough transformation of neoliberal capitalism into a novel form of democratic capitalism (2010a, 2013b), what I have discussed most recently as ‘precarity capitalism’ (2020a).

The various trajectories of my research into the political economy and the ideological dynamics of contemporary capitalism converge into the comprehensive analysis I offer in my new book Capitalism on Edge (2020a), which lays out a path for radical social change without reliance on crisis, revolution, or utopia. In this work, I construct a methodology for critical social analysis, which is then operationalised in an analysis of the transformation of capitalism over the past two centuries. This work elaborates a conception of radical social change as subversion of systemic dynamics, rather than overthrowing or resisting these dynamics.
